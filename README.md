# no-ratelimit

vulnerability name: No rate limiting leads to Email triggering

A little bit about Rate Limit:
A rate-limiting algorithm is used to check if the user session (or IP-address) has to be limited based on the information in the session cache.
In case a client makes too many requests within a given timeframe, HTTP-Servers can respond with status code 429: Too Many Requests.

1. Go to this URL https://partner-portal.persequor.com/register.php?

 2. Enter your email address name to create an account.

 3. Now you can check your email. login credentials will be there.

 4. We are going to reset password page https://partner-portal.persequor.com/reset-password.php

 5. Enter the Email address .

 6. click send token and intercept the request and  Now Send This Request To Intruder And Repeat It 1000 or n number of times By Fixing Any Arbitrary Payload Which Doesn't No Effect Request I Choose Accept-Language: en-US, en;q=0.5 $1$

 7. See You Will Get 302  Status Code & 1000+ ,  n number of emails In Your INBOX

 See It Is Resulting In Mass Mailing Or Email Bombing To Your Users Which Is Bad For Business Impact.




Solution -
I Will Recommend You To Add A ReCaptcha & Sort Of Something Which Requires Manual Human Interaction To Proceed Like You Can Add Captcha Like 2+2=___ so that it cannot be brute-forced and you also can have a limit at the backend for a particular number up to 5 times a day user can request verify Email or Link something like that will prevent you from someone exploiting this vulnerability
